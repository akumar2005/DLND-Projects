# DLND-Projects
This repository contains projects I have worked on as a student of Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree!

### Summary
Project 1 - *First Neural Network* - Build a simple two-layer neural network to predict bike share usage.
Project 2 - *Dog Project* - Use a convolutional neural network to build a dog breed classifier.

**Still in progress!**
